# AT24CX - ESP-IDF

AT24CX i2c library for ESP-IDF.
ESP-IDF template used for this project: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/peripherals/i2c/i2c_simple

## Overview

This example demonstrates usage of AT24C512 eeprom for reading/writing..

### Hardware Required

To run this example, you should have one ESP32, ESP32-S or ESP32-C based development board as well as a AT24C512 (This library works with other AT24CX variants as well). AT24C512 provides 524,288 bits of serial electrically erasable and programmable read only memory (EEPROM) organized as 65,536 words of 8 bits each. You can read the datasheet [here](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/doc1116.pdf).


#### Pin Assignment:

**Note:** The following pin assignments are used by default, you can change these in the `menuconfig` .

|                  | SDA             | SCL           |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| ESP I2C Master   | I2C_MASTER_SDA | I2C_MASTER_SCL |
| AT24CX         | SDA            | SCL            |


For the actual default value of `I2C_MASTER_SDA` and `I2C_MASTER_SCL` see `Example Configuration` in `menuconfig`.

**Note: ** There’s no need to add an external pull-up resistors for SDA/SCL pin, because the driver will enable the internal pull-up resistors.

### Build and Flash

Enter `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

```bash

```
